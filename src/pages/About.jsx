          I'm from the green lands of Bangladesh, in a city called Rangpur by
          the Dharla River. It was there where I spent my childhood and teenage
          dreams as a girl who always liked Artwork. I always enjoyed learning
          things by myself, and that's how I learned abstract art. At the time,
          I also liked to deal with a bit of Quilling Art, but what I didn't
          know was that I could be a professional in that.
          <br /> <br />
          Growing up in the enchanting city of Rangpur, I had the privilege of
          witnessing the beauty of nature, which effortlessly influenced my
          creativity. The vibrant surroundings inspired me to delve into various
          forms of art, and I found immense joy in self-learning and
          experimenting.
          <br /> <br />
          My artistic journey took flight with abstract art, where I explored
          the depths of emotions through strokes of color, embracing the
          unpredictable and the unrestrained.
          <br /> <br />
          I have successfully completed my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC)
          examination under the Dhaka Board.
          <br /> <br />
          From an early age, I discovered the joy of learning and exploring
          things on my own.
          <br /> <br />
          As I move forward, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities
          that have led me to this point. With boundless passion and a strong
          foundation in art and design, I eagerly embrace the future, ready to
          make my mark in the artistic realm and share my vision with the world.
