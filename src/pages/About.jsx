            I'm from the green lands of Bangladesh, in a city called Rangpur by
            the Dharla River. It was there where I spent my childhood and
            teenage dreams as a girl who always liked Artwork. I always enjoyed
            learning things by myself, and that's how I learned abstract art. At
            the time, I also liked to deal with a bit of Quilling Art, but what
            I didn't know was that I could be a professional in that.
            <br /> <br />
            Growing up in the enchanting city of Rangpur, I had the privilege of
            witnessing the beauty of nature, which effortlessly influenced my
            creativity. The vibrant surroundings inspired me to delve into
            various forms of art, and I found immense joy in self-learning and
            experimenting.
            <br /> <br />
            My artistic journey took flight with abstract art, where I explored
            the depths of emotions through strokes of color, embracing the
            unpredictable and the unrestrained.
            <br /> <br />
            I have successfully completed my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC)
            examination under the Dhaka Board.
            <br /> <br />
            From an early age, I discovered the joy of learning and exploring
            things on my own.
            <br /> <br />
            As I move forward, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities
            that have led me to this point. With boundless passion and a strong
            foundation in art and design, I eagerly embrace the future, ready to
            make my mark in the artistic realm and share my vision with the
            world.
